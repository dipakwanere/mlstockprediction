# Session summary — ML-Ops Stock Prediction (2025-08-22)

This file captures the work performed during the interactive session that created and hardened this ML-Ops scaffold. Use it to fast-follow the project, reproduce steps, or hand off to another engineer.

Repository
- Name: mlstockprediction
- Branch: main

When this session ended
- Date: 2025-08-22

Primary goals achieved
- Created a full ML-Ops scaffold for a stock price prediction + segmentation project.
- Implemented a Flask API to serve predictions and segmentation.
- Added training scripts for stock forecasting and segmentation.
- Created Dockerfile, docker-compose, and a GitHub Actions CI workflow.
- Added tests and ensured the unit test suite (1 test) passes in the current environment.
- Added scripts to produce dummy model artifacts so the API can run without heavy ML deps.

Important environment note (blocking for training)
- The host Python environment shows a NumPy/pandas binary import error (ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _multiarray_umath). This prevents running training locally until resolved.
- Workarounds:
  - Use conda on Windows (recommended) to get prebuilt numpy/pandas/scikit-learn wheels.
  - Or run training inside Docker (if Docker daemon is available).

Files added or significantly modified in this session
- app/
  - `__init__.py` — Flask factory
  - `routes.py` — API endpoints: `/health`, `/predict_price`, `/segment` (input validation, model-loading fallback)
  - `main.py` — exposes module-level `app` (for gunicorn) and dev-runner
- src/data/make_dataset.py — synthetic stock generator (lazy imports)
- src/models/train_stock.py — training script (lazy imports, featurize supports plain lists)
- src/models/train_segment.py — training script (lazy imports)
- model_artifacts/ — contains dummy pickles created by `scripts/create_dummy_artifacts.py`
- scripts/
  - `create_dummy_artifacts.py` — creates small pickle objects for immediate app usage
  - `client_example.py` — example API client
  - `push_to_github.ps1` — helper to add/update remote and push
- tests/
  - `test_train_stock.py` — updated to avoid requiring pandas/numpy at collection time
  - `conftest.py` — adjusts sys.path for tests
- Dockerfile & docker-compose.yml — contain container configuration; Dockerfile uses `app.main:app`
- .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml — CI workflow (tests + Docker build scaffold, pip cache added)
- README.md — quick start and instructions (cleaned)
- Makefile, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, .eslintrc.json, package.json — supporting files

What was done to ensure developer experience
- Lazy imports: heavy compiled libs (numpy, pandas, sklearn, joblib) are imported inside functions so `pytest` can collect tests without those binary deps installed.
- Dummy artifacts: `model_artifacts/stock_model.pkl` and `seg_model.pkl` were created to allow the server to start and serve predictable responses.
- Tests adjusted: unit test no longer imports pandas at collection time.

How to run the project locally (quick start)
1. Recommended: create a new conda env (Windows) to avoid NumPy DLL issues
   - conda create -n mlops python=3.11 -y
   - conda activate mlops
   - conda install -c conda-forge numpy pandas scikit-learn joblib -y
   - pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Or use a python venv (may hit binary issues on Windows):
   - python -m venv .venv
   - .venv\Scripts\pip install --upgrade pip
   - .venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start the dev server (from repo root):
   - python -m app.main
   - The app will be available at http://localhost:5000 (or http://<host-ip>:5000 if bound to all addresses)

4. Health check and example requests
   - Health: GET http://localhost:5000/health
   - Predict: POST http://localhost:5000/predict_price with JSON body {"features": [100,101,102,103,104]}
   - Segment: POST http://localhost:5000/segment with JSON body {"data": [[...], [...]]}

5. Run tests
   - pytest -q
   - Current status: 1 passed

6. Create real model artifacts (after env ready)
   - python -m src.models.train_stock
   - python -m src.models.train_segment
   - These write `model_artifacts/stock_model.pkl` and `seg_model.pkl`

Docker (optional, if Docker daemon available)
- Build: docker build -t stock-mlops:local .
- Run: docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 stock-mlops:local
- To run training inside Docker and export artifacts to host:
  - docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/model_artifacts:/app/model_artifacts stock-mlops:local python -m src.models.train_stock

CI / GitHub Actions
- CI workflow: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` runs tests and builds a Docker image. It caches pip to speed installs.
- If you want CI to build and upload artifacts/images, add registry secrets (DOCKERHUB_TOKEN, DOCKERHUB_USERNAME) and extend `build_and_push` steps.

Security note
- A GitHub token was briefly pasted during the session and the user was instructed to revoke it. Do NOT store tokens in the repo or paste them in chat. Use GitHub secrets for CI.

Outstanding / recommended next steps
1. Decide whether to produce real models in CI or locally. If locally, fix the NumPy/pandas issue (use conda). If CI, adjust workflow to train & persist artifacts (requires time and potentially artifact storage).
2. Add a simple root `/` landing page (small JSON or HTML) so hitting http://localhost:5000 returns a friendly message — optional (the user asked for this earlier).
3. Add more unit tests (prediction behavior, API contract tests) and integration tests for endpoints.
4. Add a production multi-stage Dockerfile to reduce image size.
5. Expand CI to matrix (Windows, Linux) if you need to catch platform-specific binary issues.

How to pick up where we left off (for a new engineer)
1. Clone the repo and checkout `main`.
2. Create a conda environment (recommended on Windows) and install dependencies.
3. Run `pytest` to confirm tests pass.
4. Optionally run `python -m app.main` to start the API and use the health/predict endpoints.
5. To produce real artifacts: run the training scripts once dependencies are fixed.
